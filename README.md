 ## Description 
 
 Here is a brief description of my project:
 
 This project will allow a Manager user to generate a webpage that display his/her team's basic info so that the Manager will have easy and quick access to their emails and Github profiles.
 
 On this challenge, we were given a tests and was tasked to make sure all tests pass and converting the starter code to a working code that uses Node.js command-line application.
 
 I run the application and was able to generate an HTML file under the name "team.html" under the output folder.
 A screenshot of the html can be seen on the Mock up section.
